## Setup

You need the actual Node.js LTS version to build this website (other versions may work, too).

To install all dependencies please use npm to install them (yarn should work, too, but there is no support if you run into problems).

```
npm i
```

To run the site on your machine you can use a npm script:

```
npm start
```

To build the site (you'll find the result in the `_site` folder) run

```
npm run build
```
